This is the first part of a small group project which aims to make a functional virtual assistant that can do small tasks to make life more simpler
Some updates that I want to try

1) to try and make this assistant in C++ if possible. making this in Python is a bit easy, in C++ is pretty hard
2) I tried to make the object detection code in C++, but the installation seems a bit too much. Will post more about this in future
